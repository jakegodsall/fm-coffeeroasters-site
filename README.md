# ‚òï Coffee Subscription Website - Solution

## üìù Project Overview

This is my solution to the [Coffee Subscription Website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coffeeroasters-subscription-site-5Fc26HVY6) challenge. The goal of this project was to build a responsive, 3-page website where users can customize a coffee subscription and view an order summary. I've implemented the design to look as close as possible to the provided mockups, ensuring a polished user experience across devices.

### Key Features:

- **Coffee Subscription Form**: Users can select preferences such as coffee type, grind options, delivery frequency, and more. Their selections are summarized in an order modal.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views, ensuring usability on any screen size.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover and focus states are added to all buttons and clickable elements, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Order Summary Modal**: Displays the user's selected coffee subscription options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building the web app with server-side rendering and routing.
- **TailwindCSS**: To efficiently style the components and manage responsive design.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth modal animations and other UI transitions.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. Coffee Subscription Creation

Users can go through a series of steps to customize their coffee subscription:

- Choose coffee type, quantity, grind option, and delivery frequency.
- The order summary modal dynamically updates as users make their selections.

### 2. Responsive Layout

I designed this project to adapt to multiple screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across:

- **Mobile Devices**: Optimized for small screens with touch-friendly elements.
- **Tablets**: Mid-sized layout adjustments for an improved tablet experience.
- **Desktops**: Full-size layout for larger screens with additional padding and spacing for readability.

### 4. Order Summary Modal

A summary modal appears at the end of the subscription creation process, displaying the user's choices. Users can confirm their order or go back to adjust selections.
